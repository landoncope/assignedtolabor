# Assigned To Labor

Owner: Landon Cope (landon@highpsiproducts.com). Product owner: Travis (non-technical).
Claude owns this repo: language, dependencies, architecture, and this file. Keep CLAUDE.md
current whenever a decision is made or reversed. Dates below are absolute (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Status (2026-09-04)

Pre-MVP. The repo is empty except for docs. No stack has been chosen yet; the choice is
gated on the MVP scope Landon will provide (see "Open decisions").

## What this is

Assigned To Labor is Travis's faith-oriented video project. In his prototype it is one
piece of a larger site ("The Holy Rebellion" / "WagePeace" at theholyrebellion.org):

- An **anonymous "Quick Upload"** flow: a visitor scans a QR code, is guided through a
  3-step script builder (hook / body / call-to-action), records a short testimony video
  in the browser with a teleprompter (multi-clip, merged client-side with ffmpeg.wasm),
  and submits it with no account. Videos land in an admin review queue.
- A **member dashboard** behind login: my videos, teams ("channels") with managers who
  review/route content, team chat, gamified progress (XP, streaks, badges, weekly goals,
  reflections journal), an AI script assistant, admin review of videos and roles.
- A **native iOS/Android shell** (Capacitor) that just loads the live website in a
  WebView. It is on TestFlight as build 1.0. Bundle id `org.theholyrebellion.assignedtolabor`.

The prototype's own docs are vendored verbatim in `docs/prototype-handoff/` (written by
Travis's AI session on 2026-09-04). Read `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
`FEATURE-MAP.md` there for the full picture. They describe the prototype, not this repo.

## The prototype (what exists today)

- **Code:** lives ONLY on Travis's Mac at `~/Documents/wagepeace` (iCloud-synced, no git
  remote). We do not have a copy yet. Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript,
  inline-style React components (no Tailwind except the account page), Supabase JS.
- **Hosting:** Vercel project `wagepeace`, team `travislish-8017s-projects`, deployed by
  `vercel --prod` from Travis's laptop. No staging, no CI.
- **Data:** Supabase project `wagepeace`, ref `rmiwnhvabqhhcsixyvao`, us-west-2, PG17.
  Postgres + Auth (email/password, Google OAuth, anonymous sign-ins) + Storage (private
  `videos` bucket served via signed URLs, public `avatars` bucket). Schema was applied
  by pasting SQL into the dashboard; SQL files supposedly live in `supabase/` in his tree.
- **Access:** Travis is inviting `landoncope@gmail.com` as owner on Vercel and Supabase.
  The local Vercel CLI is logged in as a different account (`landon-5551`, team
  `drafted-commerce`) and cannot see Travis's team; log in with the gmail account or use
  the web dashboards. The `supabase` CLI is not installed.
- **Verdict so far:** treat the prototype as a spec and a source of reusable pieces (the
  recorder, the upload pipeline, the quick-upload script flow, the Supabase schema), not
  as a codebase to inherit wholesale. It bundles an unrelated ministry site, has no
  version control, and deploys straight to prod. Final call after we get the code and
  the MVP scope.

## Domains

- `assignedtolabor.org` is the **primary** domain.
- `assignedtolabor.com` **redirects** to the .org (301, preserve path).
- Both registered at Namecheap by Landon. DNS: point nameservers at DigitalOcean if we
  host there (matches Landon's other apps), otherwise Namecheap DNS with records.

## Landon's environment and conventions

- Node via asdf; `.tool-versions` pins `nodejs 24.16.0`. In non-interactive shells run
  `export ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION=24.16.0` first or node/npm/vercel will not resolve.
- Preferred hosting: **DigitalOcean App Platform** (doctl account `landoncope@gmail.com`,
  team `landoncope.dev`). Reference spec: `../landoncope.dev/.do/app.yaml` (Next.js,
  `npm run build` / `npm start`, GitHub deploy-on-push from `main`, managed Postgres,
  DO-managed domains). Vercel is acceptable if Supabase stays.
- Sibling Next.js project for conventions: `../landoncope.dev` (Next.js + Drizzle + pg +
  Tailwind v4, migrations run at container start via `scripts/migrate.mjs`).
- GitHub: `landoncope/assignedtolabor`. `gh` is installed but not authenticated.
- `psql` 17 available locally. No Docker.
- Commits end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Open decisions (answer these before writing app code)

1. MVP scope: which prototype features survive? (quick upload only? dashboard? teams?
   gamification? AI script assistant? native app?)
2. Keep Supabase (auth + storage + anon sign-in already solved) or move to DO Postgres +
   DO Spaces + our own auth? Supabase is the fast path if Travis's project stays.
3. Hosting: DO App Platform (Landon's default) vs Vercel (already set up, Travis's team).
4. Is Assigned To Labor a standalone product on its own domain, or does it stay a section
   of theholyrebellion.org? Assumption: standalone on assignedtolabor.org.
5. Who moderates uploads, and what happens to approved videos (posted where)?
6. Native app: keep the Capacitor shell pointed at the new domain, or web-only for MVP?

## Working rules for Claude in this repo

- Update this file when any decision above is made, and keep the Status section dated.
- Do not put secrets in the repo; only env var names. Template goes in `.env.example`.
- Every schema change ships as a migration file in the repo, never a dashboard paste.
- Nothing deploys straight to production from a laptop; deploys come from `main`.
